# Mantra Watch

For Chanters. A small window with your mantras (Sprint Mantra, Undefeated
Mantra): a green dot while one runs, and how many party members it reaches
(+3). The moment one stops in a fight, a red banner and a sound, and the
window comes up on top without taking focus; it goes again on its own when
the mantra is back. The same alert comes at the first hit of a fight if a
mantra you ran in the last 10 minutes is off.

Below: the current fight's length and each mantra's uptime, and after it the
last fight's, with the average of the last 10. A fight runs from your first
hit to 8 s after your last; fights under 10 s aren't kept.

⚙: when to alert (in a fight, always, never) and the sound.

## What it reads

- `2B 38`, a mantra ticking (`self: caster`): a mantra ticks once a second
  on everyone it reaches, carrying who it is on and who keeps it up. Only
  yours reach the plugin. Kind `13`, `q` 2, skills 1816xxxx and 1819xxxx.
  A missed tick (2.2 s without one) is a drop.
- `04 38`, a hit (`self: actor`): the start of the record (target, flags,
  a value, who hit, the skill), only your own hits. A hit on something else
  with a skill that isn't a mantra means a fight.
- `21 36`, a map loading, and `23 36`, landing after it: a teleport. Ticks
  stop in between (3 to 7 s) and come back about a second after landing, so
  a teleport ends the fight and no alert comes until 5 s after landing.

Checked against a capture from 2026-10-14 (22:15, a party of five): your 14
ticks over 7 s, 4 party members reached, 26 fight hits.
